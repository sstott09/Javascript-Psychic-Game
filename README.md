## 03-Javascript Assignment One (Psychic Game) - Basic
...........................................................................................................

### Overview
In this assignment, I've created a simple yet compelling computer game. 

1. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
2. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.
